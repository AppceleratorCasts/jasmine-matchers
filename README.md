# Overview

This project contains a set of matchers for the jasmine test library
that are very handy for more explicit test writing and especially
more explicit error reportings.
It contains matchers such as
- toBeArray
- toBeInstanceOf
- toThrowInstanceOf
- toHaveBeenCalledXTimes
and more.


# History

This used to be our (uxebu's) collection of matchers that moved from project
to project, got extended here and there, let's share it.
